TOPIC:

Does the Density of Late-Night Trading Venues Influence the Rate of Assault Crimes in the CBD?

IMPORTANCE:

Based on data from the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (BOSCAR, 2025), it is recorded that alcohol-related assaults peak between 6pm to 3am on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. This research aims to investigate whether a correlation exists between the density of late-night trading venues and the frequency of assault crimes in central business districts (CBDs). Understanding this relationship is critical for informing policy decisions, enhancing public safety, and guiding responsible venue operations.

STAKEHOLDER RELEVANCE AND REAL-WORLD IMPACT:

This study holds significant importance to certain stakeholders, namely the NSW Police Force, Liquor and Gaming NSW, local councils and residents. The findings could support strategies to manage alcohol-related harm, such as adjusting trading hours, refining alcohol regulations, or enhancing law enforcement presence. Overall, it is to create a safer nightlife environment, while balancing economic and social interests.
